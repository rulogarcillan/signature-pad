MAJOR MODIFICATIONS FROM ORIGINAL:

Architecture & Platform:
- Complete rewrite from Java to Kotlin
- Migrated to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) with Compose Multiplatform
- Replaced Android View system with pure Compose UI
- Replaced android.graphics.* APIs with androidx.compose.ui.graphics.*
- 100% shared code in commonMain for all platforms
- Cross-platform support: Android, Desktop (JVM), iOS (planned), Web (planned)

Enhanced Drawing Engine:
- Smooth Bézier Curves with Catmull-Rom spline interpolation
- Velocity-Based Width: Dynamic stroke width (faster = thinner, slower = thicker)
- Pressure Simulation: Gamma curve adjustment for realistic pen feel
- Adaptive Smoothing: EMA (Exponential Moving Average) filters
- Noise Filtering: Configurable input threshold for hand shake elimination

Configuration & Customization:
- 9 Adjustable Parameters:
  * penMinWidth, penMaxWidth: Width range control
  * penColor: Custom stroke colors
  * velocitySmoothness: Drawing smoothness (0.0-1.0)
  * widthSmoothness: Width transition smoothness (0.0-1.0)
  * minVelocity, maxVelocity: Velocity thresholds for width mapping
  * widthVariation: Pressure simulation curve (gamma)
  * inputNoiseThreshold: Hand shake filter
- 3 Pre-configured Presets: fountainPen(), pen(), marker()
- Type-safe Configuration DSL with immutable data classes

State Management & History:
- Added full UNDO/REDO functionality with complete stroke history
- State hoisting following Compose best practices
- Immutable data structures throughout
- Stroke-level history tracking (not point-level)

Export & Output:
- Multiple export formats: SVG, Bitmap (white/transparent background)
- Smart auto-crop with configurable padding
- ImageBitmap support for KMP compatibility
- SVG path generation with optimized Bézier curves

Code Quality & Safety:
- Explicit API mode (-Xexplicit-api=strict) for type safety
- Comprehensive KDocs on all public APIs
- Consistent data class copy visibility
- Zero platform dependencies in shared code

PLATFORM TARGETS:
- Android (API 21+)
- Desktop JVM (Windows, macOS, Linux - Java 17+)
- iOS (planned for v2.0)
- Web/Wasm (planned for v2.0)

DEPENDENCIES:
- Kotlin 2.2.21
- Compose Multiplatform 1.9.3
- kotlinx-datetime 0.7.1
